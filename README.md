# R-C-Y.NET
Repository containing my personal website, viewable at www.r-c-y.net

This is a very minimal site  built with the following tools:
- [sakura](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura): a minimal classless css framework / theme.
- [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/): a modern alternative to CSS resets
- [Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord): an arctic, north-bluish color palette.
- [Email Obfuscator](http://rot13.florianbersier.com/): Javascript email obfuscator using ROT13

This site also supports `prefers-color-scheme` ([info](https://web.dev/prefers-color-scheme/)), automatically switching between light and dark mode color schemes according to browser preferences.

# Archive
Files under `./archive` were generated by a much older version of my site, which used the now-abandoned [Stacey](https://github.com/kolber/stacey) CMS. Although styling and site structure is broken without a functioning install of Stacey (and the old version of PHP it requires), the individual pages are still readable enough for documentation purposes. So they are still included despite their brokenness.
